I managed to get a silver star quite quickly. nltk's ngram function was quite a time saver I think. But I tripped up at part two. I spent three hours trying and trying. Eventually, the script gives the correct output for 40 iterations over the easier example but for the actual input the result is wrong and I don't understand why.
