use the networkx package.
node names = input numbers
weights = also the input numbers
path = get shortest path
resutl = sum(path)-the first one

G = ?
G = nx.complete_graph(range(len(mtx)))
path = shortest_path(G, source=None, target=None, weight=None, method='dijkstra')
path_weight(G, path, weight)-the first one
How to turn the string into a graph?
Just count from 1 till n from the upper left till the bottom right corner.
and add weights from mtx in a loop
