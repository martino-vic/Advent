Gave up after 2.5hrs without a silver star, I think I'm not even close. My first anwer was accidentally someone else's (1490), so at least my solution must be in a reasonable range. The problem is hard to conceptualise. At first I made a formula how FAR the probe will go. While the actual question is: Will one of the steps the probe makes be within the target area? The second misconception I had was not connecting x and y. They have to be in the target area at the same time. Next time I need a bulletproof concept and scheme before I start cowboy coding. If the logic and concept is flawed you can't write the code.
